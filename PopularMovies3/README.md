##### (Popular Movies, Stage 2)


This app is Stage 2 of the `Popular Movies`. This is the Third assignment of Nanodegree program. 

#### Project Overview

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, I build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. I split the development of this app in two stages. First, let's talk about stage
 1. In this second and final add additional functionality to the app you built in Stage 1.
 
#### Features 
- Allow users to view and play trailers (either in the youtube app or a web browser).
- Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
- Allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.
- Modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
- Lastly, I optimize the app experience for tablet.
