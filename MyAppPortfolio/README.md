# MyAppPortfolio

This app is a showcase of my app portfolio. Each button represents an app that I will build in the Nanodegree program.

#### Names of your Nanodegree apps 
- Popular Movies
- Stock Hawk
- Build it Bigger
- Make Your App Material
- Go Ubiquitous
- Capstone 

#### Current Status

Right now the app is only showing the name of the app with some default text on which you click as a toast like _'This button will launch my Make Your App Material project'_.
