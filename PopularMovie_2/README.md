##### (Popular Movies, Stage 1)


This app is to help users discover popular and recent movies. This is the second app of Nanodegree program. 

#### Project Overview

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, I build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. I split the development of this app in two stages. First, let's talk about stage
 1. In this stage I build the core experience of the movies app.
 
#### Features 
- Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
- Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
  - The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
  

- Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  - Original title
  - Movie poster image thumbnail
  - A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  - User rating (called vote_average in the api)
  - Release date
